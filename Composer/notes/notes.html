		Component strategy</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Component streams it&#39;s owned components as a list. This is not compatible with 
			Container streams, which are &#39;manager trees&#39;. Believe this can be fixed by 
			allowing Components to say if they should be streamed or not by their owner.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Control strategy</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A control CAN have an <em>owner</em> (Component) which manages the Control&#39;s name and receives 
			the Control&#39;s delegated events (a tab can be owned by an application which 
			listens for it&#39;s activation).</li>
		<li>A control CAN have a <em>manager</em> (Control) which is a controller for the object in 
			logical view-space (tab is managed by tabbar).</li>
		<li>A control CAN have a <em>parent</em> (Control) which is in charge of rendering the 
			Control (tab is parented by a scrolling field).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Container strategy</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Containers have <em>chrome</em>, which are Controls that it creates 
			intrinsically, that do not need to be streamed.</li>
		<li>Containers have <em>controls</em>, which is a list of Controls which the 
			container is responsible for streaming. These are the complement to <em>chrome</em>.</li>
		<li>Containers have <em>children</em>, which are Controls for which the container is the 
			<em>parent</em> 
			(and for which the Container is responsible for rendering).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		ChromeDocument strategy</p>
	<ul>
		<li>(when active) document has a reference to a Gizmo (this.gizmo)</li>
		<li>In other contexts, the objects listed in the chrome document config are going to 
			be chrome (static). At design-time, they are more like controls (dynamic). This 
			difference causes some problems.</li>
		<li>Gizmo document config is considered <em>chrome</em>, so all subcomponent are 
			owned by the Gizmo</li>
		<li>NOTE:&nbsp; this.gizmo is monkey patched so that <em>getControls</em> returns 
			enumerated <em>this.$</em> ... I don&#39;t remember why, must document this 
			(ComponentTree?)</li>
		<li>this.gizmo is generally owned by <em>ide</em>, but it&#39;s unclear if this is 
			important</li>
		<li>this.gizmo is created temporarily by <em>initializeSerial</em> and <em>populateComponentTree</em> in which cases it&#39;s owned by the document. TODO: 
			refactor so it&#39;s just a local reference to a gizmo and not <em>this.gizmo</em></li>
	</ul>
