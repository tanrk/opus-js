# Setup #

Checkout the Opus source from [google code](http://code.google.com/p/opus-js/source/checkout).

Opus requires the [Dojo Toolkit](http://www.dojotoolkit.org) and by default loads it from Google's cdn. To customize this, edit the _opus/dojo-depends.js_ file.

Opus Composer requires [PHP](http://www.php.net).


# Stuff to Try #

Run Composer. To save and load files, you'll need to login by clicking the Login button in the toolbar. By default, there's a single user named nobody. Documents are saved to _opus/Composer/documents/files_. You can preview what you make by clicking the Preview button in the toolbar.

Run some examples and tests. To get a sense of how things work in Opus, check out some of the examples in _opus/examples_ and test files located in _opus/tests_ and _opus/library/.../tests_.

Explore on your own.  There's no documentation yet, so you're basically on your own.  We'd love some [feedback](http://groups.google.com/group/opus-js) on how far you can get and what's hard to figure out.
